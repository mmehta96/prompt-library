Your task is to migrate the WDIO test cases in the workspace to Playwright. Follow the below guidelines to do the migration -
 
1. First make a config file following the rules that are relevant checking the wdio.conf.ts
2. Only configure Chrome browser as a playwright project as the beginning.
3. Make a directory naming /src/packages/e2e/src/playwright and use this as a parent directory for all the migrated codebase.
4. Place all the converted tests under /tests.
5. Then, Start migrating each spec one by one to playwright compatible test. Follow these subtasks closely for migration of each spec -
    5a. You will encounter import statements to page object models. Convert them first and use the updated imports while converting specs
    5b. Updated pages should be moved to /pages
    5c. Check if there is a need to convert files imported utilities. If yes, updated utils should be moved to /utils. else do nothing
    5d. After conversion of each spec, ask for confirmation from user to proceed further.
    
 
6. Finally update the package json to add playwright test command which can be used to run these tests
 
Follow these steps in order. Do not go to next step before the previous step is fully completed. Do not deviate from these steps.
